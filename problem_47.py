# write a python program that performs all compound assignment operations on an integer =>
num = int(input("please enter the number is = "))
print("the number is = "+str(num))
num += 10
print("the result of the addition compound assignment operation is = "+str(num))
num -= 10
print("the result of the subtraction compound assignment operation is = "+str(num))
num *= 10
print("the result of the multiplication compound assignment operation is = "+str(num))
num /= 10
print("the result of the division compound assignment operation is = "+str(num))
num %= 10
print("the result of the modulus compound assignment operation is = "+str(num))
num **= 10
print("the result of the square compound assignment operation is = "+str(num))
